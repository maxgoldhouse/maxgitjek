pop goes the weasel
oooo messy! And sticky, probably. Yeah those weasels eat a lot of honey you know. Weasels eat meat, they are carnivors. Yeah I know that but they like a bit of sweet after their meat. I suppose next you're gonna tell me they like to drink a drop of port and smoke a cigar in the billiard room. Weasels have a billiard room. Phuph, they kept that quiet.
